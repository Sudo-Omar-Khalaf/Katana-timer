# Bug Fixes and Enhancements - v1.2.0

## Issue 1: Notification Spamming Bug - FIXED ✅

### Problem
After 2 hours of tracking, the application was sending a notification every 500ms, causing notification spam.

### Root Cause
The notification check `dur.Hours() >= 2` was running in the timer update loop without any flag to track if the notification had already been sent.

### Solution
1. **Added notification tracking flag** (`notificationSent bool`) to the MainUI struct
2. **Modified notification logic** to only send notification once when crossing 2 hours:
   ```go
   if dur.Hours() >= 2 && !ui.notificationSent {
       beeep.Notify("Katana Time Tracker", "Session running over 2 hours!", "")
       ui.notificationSent = true
   }
   ```
3. **Reset flag on new session** to ensure each session gets its own notification

### Files Modified
- `ui/mainui.go`: Added `notificationSent` field and updated notification logic

## Issue 2: Enhanced Monthly Export - IMPLEMENTED ✅

### Problem
Export functions only exported current day's data, but user wanted full month data organized by day.

### Solution
1. **Added new storage method** `LoadSessionsForMonth()` to fetch all sessions for a specific month
2. **Created enhanced export functions**:
   - `ExportMonthlyToCSV()` - Month data with daily grouping and totals
   - `ExportMonthlyToPDF()` - Formatted PDF report with daily breakdown

3. **Updated UI** with new export buttons organized in a grid layout:
   - Daily exports: CSV, PDF (for current day only)
   - Monthly exports: CSV, PDF (for entire current month)

### New Features
- **Daily grouping**: Sessions organized by date within the month
- **Daily totals**: Shows total time per day
- **Monthly summary**: Overall month statistics
- **Empty day handling**: Shows "No activity" for days without sessions
- **Professional formatting**: Clean, readable output in all formats

### Export Format Examples

#### CSV Format
```
Date,Start Time,End Time,Duration (min),Activity,Category,Tags,Daily Total (min)
2025-09-01,09:00,10:30,90.0,Programming,work,"[""urgent""]",120.0
2025-09-01,14:00,14:30,30.0,Code Review,work,"[""review""]",
2025-09-02,,,,"No activity","","",0.0
```

#### PDF Format
- Month header with year
- Daily sections with formatted session lists
- Daily and monthly totals
- Professional layout

### Files Modified
- `storage/storage.go`: Added `LoadSessionsForMonth()` method
- `export/export.go`: Added monthly export functions and strings import
- `ui/mainui.go`: Added monthly export buttons and updated layout

## Issue 3: JSON Export Removal - IMPLEMENTED ✅

### Request
User requested removal of JSON export functionality to simplify the export options.

### Solution
1. **Removed JSON export functions**:
   - Removed `ExportToJSON()` for daily exports
   - Removed `ExportMonthlyToJSON()` for monthly exports

2. **Updated UI layout**:
   - Changed from 3-column grid to 2-column grid for daily exports (CSV, PDF)
   - Kept 2-column grid for monthly exports (CSV, PDF)
   - Removed JSON export button and related functionality

3. **Updated documentation**:
   - Removed JSON references from README.md
   - Updated feature descriptions to reflect CSV and PDF only

### Current Export Options
- **Daily Export**: CSV, PDF (current day sessions)
- **Monthly Export**: CSV, PDF (full month with daily breakdown)

### Files Modified
- `export/export.go`: Removed JSON export functions
- `ui/mainui.go`: Removed JSON export button and updated layout
- `README.md`: Updated feature descriptions

## Issue 4: System Wake-Up from Sleep Bug - FIXED ✅

### Problem
When the PC screen turns off or goes to sleep due to inactivity, alarms would not ring until the user manually woke the PC by moving the mouse or pressing a key. The alarm would then be found ringing, but it wasn't audible during sleep.

### Root Cause
The power management system (`power/power.go`) was implemented but:
1. Initial implementation used sleep prevention (system-inhibit) which prevented the PC from sleeping
2. User wanted the PC to sleep normally but wake up automatically for alarms
3. The `rtcwake` command requires sudo permissions which weren't configured
4. Without proper permissions, wake-up scheduling was failing silently

### Solution
1. **Removed sleep prevention approach**: Eliminated `PreventSleep()` functions that kept the system awake
2. **Focused on wake-up scheduling**: Uses `rtcwake` to set hardware RTC (Real-Time Clock) wake timers
3. **Created automated installer**: `install-katana.sh` handles everything automatically:
   - Auto-detects and installs rtcwake if missing
   - Finds rtcwake path dynamically on any system
   - Configures sudo permissions during installation (one-time prompt)
   - No user interaction needed after installation
4. **Updated alarm logic**: All alarm enable/disable/create operations now schedule system wake-ups
5. **Fallback mechanisms**: If rtcwake fails, tries `at` command as backup

### Technical Implementation

#### Power Management (power/power.go)
- `ScheduleWakeup()`: Sets RTC wake timer using rtcwake
- `CancelWakeup()`: Removes scheduled wake timers
- Platform-specific implementations for Linux, Windows, and macOS
- Thread-safe with mutex locks

#### Permission Setup (setup-wake-permissions.sh)
- Grants passwordless sudo access to `/usr/sbin/rtcwake`
- Creates `/etc/sudoers.d/katana-alarm-wake` with proper permissions
- Validates configuration and tests functionality
- One-time setup, no password needed afterwards

#### UI Integration (ui/mainui.go)
- Alarm creation: Automatically schedules wake-up
- Alarm enable/disable: Manages wake-up timers
- Alarm deletion: Cancels associated wake-ups
- Alarm trigger: Cancels wake-up for one-time alarms

### How System Wake-Up Works

1. **User sets alarm**: UI calls `ScheduleWakeup(alarmID, wakeTime)`
2. **RTC timer is set**: `rtcwake -m no -t <timestamp>` programs hardware RTC
3. **PC goes to sleep**: User can let system sleep normally
4. **Hardware wakes PC**: RTC triggers wake-up at scheduled time
5. **Alarm rings**: Application is running and alarm sounds

### Setup Instructions for Users

#### Automated Installation (Recommended):
```bash
cd /home/khalaf/Downloads/katana
./install-katana.sh
```

This single script handles everything:
- Installs rtcwake if missing
- Detects rtcwake path automatically
- Configures sudo permissions (one password prompt)
- Builds and installs Katana
- Creates desktop launcher
- Adds to PATH

**No further configuration needed!**

#### What Gets Configured:
- File: `/etc/sudoers.d/katana-alarm-wake`
- Permission: Passwordless sudo for rtcwake only
- Security: Limited to specific command, not general sudo access

#### To Remove Later:
```bash
sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/katana-alarm-wake
```

### Platform Support

| Platform | Method | Requires Setup |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Linux | rtcwake | Yes (one-time) |
| Windows | Task Scheduler | No |
| macOS | pmset | Yes (one-time) |

### Testing the Fix

1. **Run permission setup**:
   ```bash
   ./setup-wake-permissions.sh
   ```

2. **Set a test alarm**: Create alarm for 2-3 minutes from now

3. **Let system sleep**: Wait for screen to turn off or manually sleep

4. **Verify wake-up**: System should wake automatically and alarm should ring

5. **Check logs**: Application logs wake-up scheduling (if logging enabled)

### Files Modified
- `power/power.go`: Simplified to focus on wake-up scheduling
- `ui/mainui.go`: Updated all alarm operations to use ScheduleWakeup
- `setup-wake-permissions.sh`: New script for permission configuration

### Known Limitations

1. **Virtual Machines**: RTC wake may not work in VMs (hardware limitation)
2. **Battery Settings**: Some laptop power settings may override RTC wake
3. **BIOS/UEFI**: Wake-on-RTC must be enabled in BIOS (usually is by default)
4. **Wayland/X11**: Desktop environment doesn't affect RTC wake (hardware level)

### Troubleshooting

**If alarms don't wake the system:**

1. **Check permissions**:
   ```bash
   sudo -n rtcwake --version
   ```
   Should run without password prompt

2. **Test rtcwake manually**:
   ```bash
   sudo rtcwake -m no -t $(date -d '+2 minutes' +%s)
   ```
   Then check: `cat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm`

3. **Check BIOS settings**: Ensure "Wake on RTC" is enabled

4. **Check system logs**:
   ```bash
   journalctl -xe | grep -i rtc
   ```

**If permission setup fails:**
- Ensure you have sudo access on your system
- Check if rtcwake is installed: `which rtcwake`
- Try running the setup script again
